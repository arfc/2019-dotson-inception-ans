  abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception", which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC 2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5\% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6\% error on the test set) and 17.3\% top-1 error on the validation set.},

  abstract = {There is a need to develop an algorithm that can determine the relative activities of radioisotopes in a large data set of low-resolution gamma-ray spectra that contain a mixture of many radioisotopes. Low-resolution gamma-ray spectra that contain mixtures of radioisotopes often exhibit feature overlap, requiring algorithms that can analyze these features when overlap occurs. While machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have shown promise for the problem of radioisotope identification, their ability to identify and quantify mixtures of radioisotopes has not been studied. Because machine-learning algorithms use abstract features of the spectrum, such as the shape of overlapping peaks and Compton continuum, they are a natural choice for analyzing radioisotope mixtures. An artificial neural network (ANN) has been trained to calculate the relative activities of 32 radioisotopes in a spectrum. The ANN is trained with simulated gamma-ray spectra, allowing easy expansion of the library of target radioisotopes. In this paper, we present our initial algorithms based on an ANN and evaluate them against a series of measured and simulated spectra.},
